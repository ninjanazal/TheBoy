			INT 40 - VBlank Interrupt
				The VBlank interrupt occurs ca. 59.7 times a second on a handheld Game Boy (DMG or CGB) 
				During this period video hardware is not using VRAM so it may be freely accessed.
				This period lasts approximately 1.1 milliseconds.

			INT 48 - STAT Interrupt
				One very popular use is to indicate to the user when the video hardware is about to redraw
				a given LCD line. This can be useful for dynamically controlling the SCX/SCY registers
				($FF43/$FF42) to perform special video effects.

			INT 50 - Timer Interrupt
				Transmitting and receiving serial data is done simultaneously.
				The received data is automatically stored in SB.
				The serial I/O port on the Game Boy is a very simple 
				setup and is crude compared to standard RS-232 (IBM-PC) or RS-485 (Macintosh) serial ports.
				There are no start or stop bits.
			
			INT 60 - Joypad Interrupt
				The Joypad interrupt is requested when any of P1 bits 0-3 change from High to Low.
				This happens when a button is pressed (provided that the action/direction buttons are enabled
				by bit 5/4, respectively), however, due to switch bounce, one or more High to Low transitions 
				are usually produced when pressing a button.
